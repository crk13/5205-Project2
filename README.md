# 5205-Project2

This repository documents the complete end-to-end workflow for developing, training, and backtesting a high-frequency quantitative trading strategy.

The project is divided into the following modular stages, presented in chronological order. Each stage is contained within its own Jupyter Notebook, which includes detailed code, model-specific analysis, and findings.

> **Note on final dataset upload**  
> The `data/` folder in this repository only demonstrates the full **data-processing workflow and source code**.  
> The final merged dataset used for model execution (`final_df.csv`) exceedsGithub’s 100 MB upload limit and therefore cannot be hosted here.  
> We have **uploaded `final_df.csv` separately to Canvas** — please **download it from Canvas and place it under**  
> `5205-Project2/data/` **before running the notebooks or scripts**.

**Note on Reproducibility:**
For a detailed breakdown of the final strategy's implementation, precise reproduction commands, and expected outputs (as required by the "Reproducibility check"), please see the detailed in each readme.
